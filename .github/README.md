## Motive
To automate my CV generation, and make it easier to maintain.
All content defined in YAML, then a script generates a LaTeX PDF and deploy a web version.
I did it this way so that I don't need to f\*\*k around with Microsoft Word.

  <summary>About the Developer</summary>


> **Professional Background**<br>
> I'm an experienced, Principal-level full stack engineer with a passion for quality, performance, mentoring, technology and open source. I believe the best judge of a developer is their code, and while I cannot share proprietary work, I have many open source projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Daniel-wambua) and showcase my skills at [danielwambua.dev](https://danielwambua.dev).
>
> This CV automation project reflects my philosophy: why spend time on repetitive tasks when you can build systems that work for you? The entire CV generation pipeline is designed for maximum efficiency and maintainability.

## About

The resume content is defined in [`resume.yml`](/resume.yml) following the [jsonresume.org](https://jsonresume.org/) standard, and validated against [`schema.json`](/schema.json).
A LaTeX document is then generated from [`template.jinja`](/template.jinja) formatted with [`resume-format.cls`](/tex/resume-format.cls), which is then [compiled into a PDF](https://github.com/Daniel-Wambua/cv/actions/workflows/compile.yml) by GitHub Actions, and published under the [Releases](https://github.com/Daniel-Wambua/cv/releases) tab.

The system features automatic PDF generation through a web download endpoint - when you visit the download link, the PDF is dynamically generated from the YAML source, ensuring it's always up-to-date. A markdown version is also generated by [`lib/markdown.py`](/lib/markdown.py), as well as a CV website which is built as a static site with SvelteKit, and deployed to GitHub Pages and Vercel, at [cv.danielwambua.dev](https://cv.danielwambua.dev).

The entire pipeline is optimized for content accuracy and layout precision, with automatic handling of link overflow and content formatting to ensure professional presentation.

Why? ...Because why spend 30 minutes writing your CV, when you could spend 30 hours automating it, obviously!

## Usage

### Option #1 - GitHub
1. Fork the repo
2. Update resume.yml with your own content
3. Create [a tag](/.github/workflows/tag.yml), or trigger the GH actions workflow
4. ....and a PDF and website gets magically generated


<details><summary>Workflows</summary>

| Workflow     | Description      | Status                     |
| :----------- | :--------------- | :------------------------: |
| `tag`        | Creates a new Git tag. Optionally specify the tag name and description, or by default it will just bump the sem ver patch number by 1 | [![üè∑Ô∏è Tag](https://github.com/Daniel-wambua/cv/actions/workflows/tag.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Daniel-wambua/cv/actions/workflows/tag.yml)  |
| `generate`   | Generates your resume in PDF form as an artifact. If triggered by a tag, then a new release will be created, with the PDF attatched   | [![Generate PDF](https://github.com/Daniel-wambua/cv/actions/workflows/compile.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Daniel-wambua/cv/actions/workflows/compile.yml) |
| `validate`   | Validates your resume data against the schema. This will also run whenever a new PR is opened, to ensure it's valid and working | [![‚òëÔ∏è Validate Resume](https://github.com/Daniel-wambua/cv/actions/workflows/validate.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Daniel-wambua/cv/actions/workflows/validate.yml) |
| `mirror`     | Backups up repository and content to our (non-Microsoft) Codeberg mirror | [![ü™û Mirror to Codeberg](https://github.com/Daniel-wambua/cv/actions/workflows/mirror.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Daniel-wambua/cv/actions/workflows/mirror.yml) |

</details>

### Option #2 - Local
See the [`Makefile`](/Makefile) for all the available commands. Or, just run `make` from the root, to install deps, validate content, generate LaTex, and compile PDF

1. Clone the repo
2. Update resume.yml with your own content
1. Run `make` from the root, to install deps, validate content, generate LaTex, and compile PDF

Or, to deploy the web version
1. Follow steps above (clone, edit, validate)
2. Run `make web` to generate `dist/`
3. upload to any CDN, web server or static hosting provider (I use Vercel)

<details><summary>Commands</summary>

- `make install` - Download dependencies
- `make validate` - Validate content
- `make generate` - Generate LaTex
- `make compile` - Compile PDF
- `make clean` - Remove generated files
- `make watch` - Watch for changes, recompile and refresh
- `make web` - Launches web version, installs NPM deps, builds and serves the site

## Editing
Modify data by editing [`resume.yml`](/resume.yml)<br>
If you need to customize the layout, edit [`template.jinja`](/template.jinja)<br>
Or to change the styles and formatting, edit [`resume-format.cls`](/tex/resume-format.cls)<br>
All the scripts used to generate output are located in [`lib/`](/lib/)<br>
These are triggered either by the [`Makefile`](/Makefile) or via GitHub Actions with the [`workflows/`](/.github/workflows)<br>
The source for the website version is located in [`web/`](/web)
