      `I'm a builder at heart.
      Whether it's a global-scale trading platform or a fun little CLI tool to check website privacy,
      I love creating software that's fast, accessible, secureâ€”and actually helps people.`,
      
      `I've been coding professionally for over a decade, but tinkering with tech for much longer than that.
      I care deeply about clean code, thoughtful architecture, and empowering others to do their best work.
      I've lead engineering teams across startups, scale-ups and large enterprises,
      always with the same objective in mind: to deliver high-quality, scalable solutions that meet the needs of users and businesses alike.`,

      `But what I really love, is the world of open source. I've published 100+
      production grade tools/applications, and have contributed to many, many more.
      On GitHub, I'm among one of the top developers world-wide, with 70k+ stars,
      1 million+ lines of hand-written code, and 10 million+ Docker downloads.`,

      // `Recently, I was invited to join the GitHub Accelerator program.
      // And have also won several awards and been featured in a few industry publications.`,

      `In terms of tech stacks, I'm a full-stack developer by trade, with a focus on modern, scalable frontends.
      But I'm very well versed in backend technologies too, and have a strong understanding of DevOps and cloud infrastructure.
      I'm pretty quick to pick up new languages and techstacks, and love learning new things.
      So I'm always in the position to objectively choose the best tools for the job, and to help others do the same.`,

      `I enjoy wearing many hats: architect, engineer, mentor, product-thinker,
      and occasional DevRel. But above all, I love working with kind,
      curious people to build great thingsâ€”and leaving things better than I found them.`,

      `A cause that is close to my heart, is data privacy and security.
      I believe that everyone should have the right to control their own data,
      and it's our responsibility as developers to help them do that.
      This has been a theme in a lot of the services I've built.
      `,

      `In my spare time, I'm usually tinkering with my homelab, building fun little projects,
      or failing at HackerRank challenges.
      And away from the keyboard, I enjoy sports (I spent 10 years in the British Army reserves),
      and I also love a good adventure!
      After work, you'll usually find me in the pub with friends and colleagues,
      chatting about the latest tech trends and sharing ideas.
